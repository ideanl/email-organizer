This project is an attempt at email organization using K-Means Clustering.
The 'new/' directory contains the final version of the code after using more
python libraries.

Results (In Progress)
So far, clusters are working because there are groups of very similar emails
in each cluster. However, html tag attributes and CSS is still being included
in the term matrices so that needs to be resolved. That may improve the quality
of the clusters. Additionally, more preprocessing such as SVD may help as the
clusters are showing signs of being overly specific.
