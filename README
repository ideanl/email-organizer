This project is an attempt at email organization using K-Means Clustering.
The 'new/' directory contains the final version of the code after using more
python libraries.

Results
Not ideal. The clustering does not work effectively if the dataset has an
abnormally large amount of similar emails that are strange in nature.
To resolve this issue, a different clustering algorithm that still works
on large datsets, but that works better on uneven datasets may work better.
This is a future project idea.
